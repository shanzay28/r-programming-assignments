## Introduction

R Markdown is a document format that lets you combine **narrative text**, **R code**, and **math formulas** in a single file with the `.Rmd` extension. Instead of running code in R and then copying the results into Word, you keep everything together. When you *knit* the document, R runs all the code chunks and converts the file into a clean HTML (or PDF/Word) report with your text, tables, and plots.

This makes your work more **reproducible**, because anyone with your `.Rmd` file can re-run the analysis and recreate the same output.

## Narrative Text and LaTeX Math

R Markdown uses simple **Markdown** syntax for formatting text. For example:

- `#` starts a big heading  
- `##` starts a smaller heading  
- `**bold**` → **bold**  
- `*italic*` → *italic*  
- `-` creates bullet points  

R Markdown also supports **LaTeX math**. An inline math expression like  
`$\\alpha + \\beta = \\gamma$` will render as: $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$.

A displayed equation (on its own line) uses double dollar signs:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i
$$

This is the formula for the sample mean: you add up all values $x_i$ and divide by the number of observations $n$.

## R Code Chunks: Loading a Library and Dataset

R code goes inside **code chunks**, which start with three backticks and `{r}` and end with three backticks. When you knit, R runs all of these chunks in order.

The chunk below loads a library and explores a built-in dataset:

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
# Load ggplot2 for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# Use the built-in mtcars dataset
head(mtcars)
```
## Simple Analysis and Plot
summary(mtcars$mpg)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
geom_point() +
labs(
title = "Horsepower vs. Miles per Gallon (mtcars)",
x = "Horsepower (hp)",
y = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)"
)
